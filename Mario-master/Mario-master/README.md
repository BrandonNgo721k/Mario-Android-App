Comments: The code is designed to end when level 3 is cleared or mario's lives reach 0. At that point Game Over is displayed and 
the application is closed. To move mario, click directly at the top of the screen above mario to jump up (click center top to jump), 
in order to move towards the right click the right bottom of the screen (right bottom to move right), and to move left click the 
left bottom of the screen (left bottom to move left). In order to throw fire click on at the center bottom of the screen. A fire
will travel 6 spaces to the left or right based on the state of mario (mario state could be left or right), also keep in mind to throw
fire mario must be in his throw fire state which he reaches after getting a fireflower. The fire blast will end before 6 spaces if it 
is inhibited by an object. Each click left or right will move you one space; however, each click to jump will make you jump up 3 spaces.
Once you have killed any enemy, it will vanish. But, if an enemy kills you and you still have lives remaining, you will revive in the center of the screen and begin dropping down, prepare to move because the enemys are after you once again!
